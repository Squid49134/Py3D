3D Field Tracer Documenation
----------------------------

Python Wrapper: TracerWrapper.py
Shared C Library: TracerFunctions.c

compiling shared library:
    gcc -o TracerFunctions.so -shared -fPIC TracerFunctions.c

User Methods:
*all methods are fairly well error proof so the user cannot cause segmentation faults
*3D plots use colormeshs with low resolution to save time, if desired there
    are options in the code called cstride and rstride which both = 10 and can
    be lowered to increase this resolution

    TraceField(B, Start, ds, passes, Saves = None)
        * recursive allowing user to quickly trace multiple points
        - B is a length 2 or 3 vector of the magnetic field data
        - Start is a length 2 or 3 vector of the starting location
        - ds is the differential step, can be any size
        - passes is a rough estimate of the number of passes through the simulation
            can be any size
        - Saves is an optional vector of string path names to save the X, Y and Z data
        OPTIONS - 
            TraceField([Bx, By], [X, Y]):
                Traces and plots a 2D line over a colormesh of |B|, ds and passes
                are not adjustable
            TraceField([Bx, By, Bz], [X, Y, Z], .1, 100):
                Traces and Plots 3D line projections, offers the user an option to plot
                puncture plots and a 3D plots over colormeshs of |B|, this takes extra time
            TraceField([Bx, By, Bz], [X, Y, Z], .1, 100, ['TraceX.npy', 'TraceY.npy', 'TraceZ.npy']):
                Will save the 3D trace data
            TraceField([Bx, By, Bz, Ex, Ey, Ez], [X, Y, Z], .1, 100):
                Will also total E interpolated along the path of the trace, print the total
                and plot the total per step

    MapSeparator(Saves, B, Ystart, UPorLOW, N = 1):
        - Saves is a vector of string path names to save the X, Y and Z data
        - B is a length 3 vector of the magnetic field data
        - Ystart is a point close to the separator at point [0, Ystart, 0] which
            provides a starting point for the mapping.  This is easy to find 
            using the TraceField method and trial and error.
        - UPorLow is a string, either 'Upper' or 'Lower' which tells the program
            to look for a separator sheet which is either above (in the Y direction)
            the reconnection zone or below it respectively
        - N is the integer resolution, 1 represents doing every point in the simulation
            2 would be every other point, 4 every fourth point and so on
        OPTIONS - 
            MapSeparator(['SepX.npy', 'SepY.npy', 'SepZ.npy'], [Bx, By, Bz], Ystart, 'Upper', N = 1):
                Finds the upper separator sheet, and saves the data
            MapSeparator(['SepX.npy', 'SepY.npy', 'SepZ.npy'], [Bx, By, Bz], Ystart, 'Lower', N = 1):
                Finds the lower separator sheet, and saves the data

    SeparatorLoader(PathSepX, PathSepY, PathSepZ, Xsize, Ysize, Zsize, B = None):
        * lower separator is problematic, it can be mapped but the location
            is very dependant on the number of passes, this can be seen using
            the separator slice method with B included
        - PathSepX, Y and Z are string path names to the separator data to be loaded
        - Xsize, Ysize and Zsize are integer sizes of the simulation
        - B is an optional length 3 vector of the magnetic field data
        OPTIONS - 
            SeparatorLoader('SepX.npy', 'SepY.npy', 'SepZ.npy', 2048, 1024, 1024):
                quickly plots projections of the separator
            SeparatorLoader('SepX.npy', 'SepY.npy', 'SepZ.npy', 2048, 1024, 1024, [Bx, By, Bz]):
                Also plots projection of separator down Z axis over a colormesh of |B| as 
                well as a 3D plot of the separator over |B|

    SeparatorSlice(PathSepX, PathSepY, PathSepZ, Xsize, Ysize, Zsize, B = None):
        * recursive allowing user to quickly slice multiple points
        - PathSepX, Y and Z are string path names to the separator data to be loaded
        - Xsize, Ysize and Zsize are integer sizes of the simulation
        - B is an optional length 3 vector of the magnetic field data
        OPTIONS - 
            SeparatorSlice('SepX.npy', 'SepY.npy', 'SepZ.npy', 2048, 1024, 1024):
                Offers the user the option to slice the separator at any integer point along
                the X or Z axis, and plots Xline projections down the X and Y axes.
            SeparatorSlice('SepX.npy', 'SepY.npy', 'SepZ.npy', 2048, 1024, 1024, [Bx, By, Bz]):
                Also traces a point starting just above and just below the separator sheet
                at points [0, SepY[0] +/- .3, 0] and then creates a puncture plot of these two
                traces, plotting it over the separator slice at the point selected
